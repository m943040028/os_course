# ENTRY POINT	
#   This code should be stored in the first sector of the hard disk.
#   After the BIOS initializes the hardware on startup or system reset,
#   it loads this code at physical address 0x7c00 - 0x7d00 (512 bytes).
#   Then the BIOS jumps to the beginning of it, address 0x7c00,
#   while running in 16-bit real-mode (8086 compatibility mode).
#   The Code Segment register (CS) is initially zero on entry.
#	
# This code switches into 32-bit protected mode so that all of
# memory can accessed, then calls into C.

#   and subsequent 80286-based PCs wanted to retain maximum compatibility),
#   physical address line 20 is tied to low when the machine boots.
#   Obviously this a bit of a drag for us, especially when trying to
#   address memory above 1MB.  This code undoes this.

# Switch from real to protected mode:
#   Up until now, there's been no protection, so we've gotten along perfectly
#   well without explicitly telling the processor how to translate addresses.
#   When we switch to protected mode, this is no longer true!
#   We need at least to set up some "segments" that tell the processor it's
#   OK to run code at any address, or write to any address.
#   The 'gdt' and 'gdtdesc' tables below define these segments.
#   This code loads them into the processor.
#   We need this setup to ensure the transition to protected mode is smooth.
